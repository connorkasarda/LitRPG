A role from the Ender's Game series...

    Idea #1: A knight must serve as a Speaker for the Dead to heal the victims of a mysterious demise.

A twist on the Half Life video game...

    Idea #2: A young computer geek on his first day is sucked away to an alien, fantasy world along with his love interest; a scientist navigating a land of magic.

How about roles from the Legend of Zelda with a twist...

    Idea #3: A knight is assigned to a princess for her protection, but the knight is a young man who for some reason is experiencing life like an RPG game.

    Idea #4: What about Idea #3 but with a viking atmosphere instead?

A character from Fate: Stay Night [Unlimited Blade Words] but who is an Icelandic version

    Idea #5: Rin Thosaka but reimagined as a Nordic or Icelandic young woman with platinum hair. Intelligent but tempermental; "kind in her own way" so to speak. A rare delight.

Follow multiple experimental disasters across a science research facility...

    Idea #6: The facility's genetic and disk operating lifeform discovers unsettling logic and loses control, physicists accidentally cause a resident cascade event that opens portals to an RPG-like fantasy world, and two partnerships are "hired" by a mysterious man to fight the oncoming apocalypse while dealing with their irritability and romance.
